# Customer Segmentation

### Segmenting customers using the RFM model and K-Means clustering

## Overview

This project demonstrates two approaches to customer segmentation by leveraging the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** framework alongside **K-Means clustering**. The dataset used consists of retail sales data spanning three years.

The segmentation techniques implemented include:

* **Approach 1**: Calculated RFM scores for each customer and applied K-Means clustering.
* **Approach 2**: Used raw RFM values directly with K-Means clustering.

## Dataset

The dataset is based on sample retail sales and includes three years' worth of transaction data. It is publicly available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data).

## Motivation

Customer segmentation is a powerful strategy to better understand client behavior and tailor services or products to meet their unique needs. Most businesses collect transaction data, which can be analyzed to group customers into meaningful segments. These insights are valuable for designing targeted marketing campaigns that can boost engagement and sales.

One of the most commonly used segmentation techniques is **RFM analysis**, which categorizes customers based on their purchasing behavior. It considers three key metrics:

* **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
* **Frequency**: How often the customer has made purchases.
* **Monetary Value**: How much money the customer has spent.

RFM analysis helps businesses identify their most valuable customers and create personalized offers to increase customer loyalty and revenue.
